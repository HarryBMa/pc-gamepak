//! The create-cartridge wizard: turn a drive into a cartridge.
//!
//! The full build, in order, each step optional except the last two:
//!
//!   1. format the drive to btrfs or exFAT     (opt in, destructive)
//!   2. copy the game onto it and register the
//!      cartridge as a Steam library           (opt in, slow)
//!   3. copy the cover art
//!   4. write cartridge.conf                   (always)
//!   5. write autorun.inf for the drive's name and icon in Explorer
//!
//! Game lists come from Playnite when it is installed — it aggregates Steam,
//! GOG, Epic, Xbox, emulators and anything added by hand — and from Steam's own
//! manifests otherwise, which is also the only option on Linux.
