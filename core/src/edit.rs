//! Changing a cartridge that already exists.
//!
//! Everything a cartridge says about itself lives in two small files —
//! `cartridge.conf` and `autorun.inf` — and a picture or two. Renaming a
//! collection, fixing a typo, swapping cover art or dropping a game from the
//! list should therefore cost nothing, and until now it meant writing the whole
//! cartridge again: hours, if the games were copied onto it.
//!
//! So this rewrites only the metadata. **Nothing here copies, deletes or moves a
//! game.** Taking a game out of the list leaves its files exactly where they
//! are; the launcher simply stops offering it, and putting it back is a matter
//! of typing its launch target again.
