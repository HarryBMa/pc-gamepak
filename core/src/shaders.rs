//! The shader cache, carried between machines.
//!
//! A game's first hour on a new machine is its worst hour: every pipeline it
//! uses has to be compiled before it can be drawn, and the stutter that causes
//! is the single most noticeable difference between a game you have played and
//! the same game on somebody else's PC. The cartridge has just carried 60 GB of
//! that game across the room. Carrying the compiled shaders as well costs a few
//! hundred megabytes and removes the whole problem.
//!
//! # Why this is so much simpler than `saves`
//!
//! Because it is a cache. Every byte here is derived from files the cartridge
//! already carries, so losing it costs time and never data — which means the
//! machinery [`crate::saves`] needs does not apply. There is no conflict case to
//! refuse: if two machines both warmed a cache, either one is correct and the
//! newer is merely better. Nothing is backed up before being replaced, because
//! there is nothing to lose. The rule is "newest wins", and that is the whole of
//! it.
//!
//! # Where the cache actually lives
//!
//! Steam keeps a per-game shader cache at `steamapps/shadercache/<appid>` inside
//! **the library the game is installed in**. That matters here more than it looks:
//! when `steamlib` registers a cartridge as a Steam library, Steam may put the
//! cache on the cartridge by itself. So the host side is looked for across every
//! library Steam knows about, *excluding any that live on the cartridge* — syncing
//! a drive with itself is not a thing to do by accident.
//!
//! Not covered, and worth knowing: Mesa's global cache
//! (`~/.cache/mesa_shader_cache`) and NVIDIA's (`~/.nv/GLCache`) are shared by
//! every program on the machine, not per game, so nothing here can carry one
//! cartridge's share of them. Steam's per-app directory is the one that is both
//! per-game and large.
//!
//! # Why it is per cartridge
//!
//! Because it is a trade against the drive's speed. On a fast NVMe cartridge,
//! carrying a warm cache is free. On a cheap USB stick, a few hundred megabytes
//! copied at insert and again at eject is a wait the user did not ask for, to
//! avoid a stutter they might not notice. Only the person who made the cartridge
//! knows which drive it is, so the cartridge says:
//!
//! ```text
//! shader_cache=drive
//! ```
