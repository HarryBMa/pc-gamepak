//! Check a cartridge you already have.
//!
//! The manifest is written and checked at copy time, but until now nothing
//! re-checked a cartridge on demand — so a drive that was written over a
//! failing cable had no way to answer the only question that matters, which is
//! whether the bytes on it are still the bytes that were meant to be there.
//!
//! Everything here is read-only. It reads `.gamepak/manifest.json`, reads every
//! file it names, and compares. It never writes to the cartridge.
//!
//!     verify-cart D:\        check every file against the manifest
//!
//! Exit status is 0 when the cartridge is intact and 1 when it is not, so this
//! can sit in a script.
