//! Did the bytes actually arrive?
//!
//! A cartridge is written over USB, often 60 GB of it, sometimes through a
//! bridge chip in a £12 enclosure that is also getting warm. Copies mostly work.
//! When they do not, the failure is silent: `std::fs::copy` reports success for
//! every byte the kernel accepted, and a truncated or flipped-bit game shows up
//! later as a crash on a level you have not played yet.
//!
//! So the wizard checks its own work. Each file is summed as it is copied —
//! CRC-32 costs nothing next to a USB write — and then the cartridge is read
//! back and the sums compared. That is one extra pass over the drive, and it is
//! on by default, because the first cartridge ever checked on real hardware
//! failed: two 2 GB archives out of 107 GB, both the right length, both with
//! different contents, written through a bridge that was resetting the bus
//! every twenty seconds. The copy reported success for all of it.
//!
//! **This is an integrity check, not a signature.** CRC-32 is the right tool for
//! "did this survive the cable", the same job it does in zip and gzip, and the
//! wrong tool for "did somebody change this on purpose". Nothing here defends
//! against a person; it defends against a cable, a bridge and a hot drive.
