//! Who is still using the cartridge.
//!
//! Eject is the most destructive thing this project does on purpose. Everything
//! else either reads the drive or writes to it while watching; eject takes the
//! volume away, and if a game is still reading from it the game is gone —
//! along with, since saves started travelling on the cartridge, whatever it was
//! part-way through writing there.
//!
//! So before unmounting anything, ask the operating system who has the volume
//! open, and be specific about it. "Something is using the drive" is not
//! actionable. "TombRaider.exe is running from it, and Explorer's working
//! directory is inside it" tells somebody what to close.
//!
//! # What counts as holding the volume
//!
//! Four separate things, because they fail differently and a user can act on
//! each one:
//!
//! * **The program itself is on the drive.** Killing it is safe-ish and is
//!   usually what the user wants; the alternative is that the process dies
//!   anyway the moment the volume goes, at a time nobody chose.
//! * **A file is open.** A save being written is the case that matters, and the
//!   one where pulling the drive corrupts something rather than merely ending
//!   it.
//! * **A file is mapped into memory.** Game data is normally mapped, not read,
//!   and a mapped file whose device disappears takes the process down with a
//!   bus error rather than an error it can handle.
//! * **A working directory is inside it.** Holds the mount busy without holding
//!   any file, which is why an unmount can fail with nothing obviously open —
//!   the classic "device is busy" with no culprit in sight.
//!
//! # What this cannot see
//!
//! On Linux, another user's processes. `/proc/<pid>/fd` is readable by its owner
//! and root, so an unprivileged launcher can enumerate the user's own processes
//! and nothing else. That is reported rather than hidden: [`Holders::unchecked`]
//! counts the processes that could not be looked at, and a caller that finds no
//! holders and a non-zero count has learned less than it looks.
//!
//! On Windows this sees running programs whose executable is on the volume, and
//! not open handles. Handle enumeration there needs either the Restart Manager
//! against a file list or `NtQuerySystemInformation`, and the second is
//! undocumented. Windows also answers the underlying question itself — its
//! dismount fails with a veto — so the guard here is the part that can say
//! *what* to close, not the part that decides whether it is safe.
