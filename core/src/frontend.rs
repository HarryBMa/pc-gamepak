//! Which front-end a cartridge opens in.
//!
//! The launcher is one answer, not the only one. It ships with the project and
//! is on by default, because a cartridge that does nothing when you plug it in
//! is broken and because the launcher is the only front-end that needs no
//! second install. Everything else is a **plugin**: a separate thing, in a
//! separate process, usually in a separate repository, that puts the cartridge
//! where its own users already look — a row on the Steam home screen, a library
//! entry in Playnite.
//!
//! # What this module is, and is not
//!
//! It is a register of names and a record of which ones are switched on. It does
//! not start plugins, talk to them, or know how they work. That is the point:
//! a Decky plugin is Python inside Steam's own process tree and a Playnite
//! extension is C# inside Playnite's, and nothing sensible can drive either from
//! here.
//!
//! What they share is this file. A plugin reads the same `settings.json` the
//! launcher writes, finds whether it is the designated front-end, and behaves
//! accordingly. That is the whole contract, and it is deliberately the smallest
//! one that works: no socket, no daemon, no protocol to version.
//!
//! ```json
//! { "frontends": { "launcher": false, "decky": true } }
//! ```
//!
//! On a Steam Deck that says: do not open a window, the row on the home screen
//! is the front-end. The launcher reads it and quits on insert; the Decky plugin
//! reads it and draws its row.
//!
//! # Why more than one may be on
//!
//! Because the machine decides, not the format. A desktop that also runs
//! Playnite may reasonably want both the cartridge's own window and a library
//! entry; a Deck almost certainly wants only the row. Nothing here enforces a
//! single choice, and no front-end is entitled to assume it is alone.
