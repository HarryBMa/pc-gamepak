//! Putting a Steam game on the cartridge so Steam plays it *from* the cartridge.
//!
//! Copying `steamapps/common/<game>` onto a drive achieves nothing on its own:
//! `steam://rungameid/<appid>` asks Steam to launch whatever copy Steam knows
//! about, and Steam only knows about folders listed in its own
//! `config/libraryfolders.vdf`. So a cartridge that really holds the game needs
//! three things:
//!
//!   1. `<drive>/steamapps/common/<installdir>` — the game files;
//!   2. `<drive>/steamapps/appmanifest_<appid>.acf` — how Steam recognises it;
//!   3. the drive listed in Steam's `libraryfolders.vdf`.
//!
//! Step 3 edits Steam's own configuration, so the original is copied to
//! `libraryfolders.vdf.bak-cartridge` first and Steam must be closed — it
//! rewrites that file from memory on exit and would undo the change.
