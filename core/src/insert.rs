//! What should happen when a cartridge is plugged in.
//!
//! Until now the answer was fixed: a window opens. That is right on a desktop
//! and wrong in at least three other situations — a machine where the cartridge
//! is being written to rather than played, an HTPC that wants the game and not a
//! launcher, and somebody who finds a window appearing on its own rude.
//!
//! # Why the decision lives here and not in the watcher
//!
//! Three separate things open the launcher on insert: the resident watcher
//! (Windows, and the rootless Linux install), `gamepak-launcher-helper.sh`
//! (which udev runs for a system install), and the tray menu. Putting the choice
//! in any one of them would mean the other two ignored it, and a setting that is
//! obeyed depending on how you installed the program is worse than no setting.
//!
//! So the launcher decides, before it builds a window, and everything that
//! starts the launcher gets the behaviour for free.
//!
//! # Why `AutoLaunchGame` will not run a program off the cartridge
//!
//! This project's oldest promise is that nothing on a cartridge runs without a
//! click. `autorun.inf`'s `open=` key is deliberately ignored for exactly that
//! reason — it is the original removable-media malware vector, and Windows
//! itself stopped honouring it on non-optical media in Windows 7.
//!
//! Auto-launch keeps the promise by only ever starting a *URI*: `steam://`,
//! `heroic://` and the rest. Those are handled by a launcher already installed
//! on the machine, opening a game the user already owns; the operating system
//! made that association, not the cartridge. A cartridge that carries its own
//! executable still gets a window and still waits for a click — which is the
//! common case for a drive somebody handed you, and the one where auto-running
//! would be handing a stranger's binary the machine.
