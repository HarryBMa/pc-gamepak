//! The game's home directory, on the cartridge.
//!
//! [`crate::saves`] carries saves by declaring where they are: a `save=` line
//! per game, a token the host resolves, and a copy in whichever direction
//! changed. That works for a game the cartridge only *points at* — a Steam
//! game launched through Steam, whose environment this project never touches —
//! and it has the cost every declaration has. Somebody has to find out where
//! the game keeps its saves, write it down, and be right.
//!
//! For a game the cartridge **carries** and this launcher **starts itself**,
//! none of that is necessary, and Kazeta is the reason this is written down.
//! Reading it closely, its save capture is not the overlayfs at all — the
//! overlay is there so a read-only cart can be written to. The capture is one
//! line: `export HOME="${BASE_DIR}/run/cart"`. Point a game's home at the
//! writable layer and every save it writes lands there, with nobody having
//! researched anything.
//!
//! A PC GamePak cartridge is already writable, so it does not need the overlay
//! to get the same result. It needs the environment, which costs no privileges,
//! no mount, no root and no dependency:
//!
//! | | |
//! |---|---|
//! | Linux | `HOME`, and the four `XDG_*_HOME` directories |
//! | macOS | `HOME`, which `~/Library` follows on its own |
//! | Windows | `USERPROFILE`, `APPDATA`, `LOCALAPPDATA` |
//!
//! # Why it is off unless a cartridge asks
//!
//! Changing a game's idea of home is not free. A game that keeps its settings
//! per machine will find none and start at its defaults; one that expects
//! something else in `$HOME` may not start at all. The cartridge's author knows
//! whether their game is portable and the host does not, so the cartridge says:
//!
//! ```text
//! executable=Game/start.sh
//! portable_home=yes
//! ```
//!
//! # What this does not catch
//!
//! * **A game launched by something else.** A `steam://` cartridge is started
//!   by Steam, in Steam's environment. `save=` lines are still the answer there.
//! * **An absolute path outside home.** A game writing to `/var/games` escapes
//!   this as surely as it escapes a declaration.
//! * **Symlinks, on exFAT.** A game whose config directory contains one will
//!   fail to create it. btrfs and NTFS cartridges have no such problem, and
//!   `docs/MANUAL.md` already recommends against exFAT for carried games.
//!
//! The cache is the one directory deliberately left on the host: a shader or
//! asset cache is rebuildable by definition, it is the largest and most
//! rewritten thing a game produces, and putting it on removable flash costs
//! write cycles and speed to preserve something nobody wants preserved.
