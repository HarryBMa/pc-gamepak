//! Telling the drive which blocks it no longer has to keep.

//! A cartridge is a DRAM-less SSD behind a USB bridge, which is the worst case
//! for a flash translation layer: it cannot borrow host memory over USB the way
//! it would over PCIe, so its garbage collector has less to work with and needs
//! erased blocks to be genuinely free. Deleting a game only frees the space in
//! the filesystem — the drive still believes every one of those blocks holds
//! live data until something says otherwise.
//!
//! That something is TRIM, and on removable media nothing sends it on a
//! schedule: Linux mounts external volumes without `discard`, and Windows only
//! optimises drives it considers fixed.
//!
//! It is best-effort by nature. Many USB bridges do not pass the command
//! through at all, and a refusal is not a failure worth stopping a build for.
