//! Playing a cartridge game with no window.
//!
//! `pc-gamepak --drive D:\ --play 0` is for a front-end that has its own Play
//! button — Playnite's slot, a script, a desktop shortcut. It does what the
//! launcher window does around a launch, and nothing it shows:
//!
//! 1. settle a session that never closed, and bring the saves and shader caches
//!    off the cartridge;
//! 2. count the launch and start the game, the same call the window's Play makes;
//! 3. **stay running while the game does**, keeping the session's heartbeat;
//! 4. then close the session and take the saves and caches back to the drive.
//!
//! Staying up is the point. The front-end that started this is watching this
//! process, so its own play time is right, and the cartridge's hours are
//! measured rather than recorded as zero the way an auto-launch has to.
//!
//! # Knowing when the game has ended
//!
//! The launcher does not own the game's process — a Steam game is Steam's child,
//! not ours. What it can see is [`crate::busy::holders`]: a program running from
//! the cartridge. So the game is running while something on the drive is — or,
//! for a Steam game, while anything runs from its install folder in *any* Steam
//! library ([`steam_install_dir`]), because Steam may start another copy than
//! the cartridge's. [`Watch`] turns a poll of that into "still going" or "over",
//! with room for a slow start and for a game that restarts itself.
//!
//! A cartridge that only points at a game installed elsewhere has nothing on the
//! drive to watch. That is known before launching ([`CartridgeInfo::holds_game`])
//! and it gets the auto-launch treatment: started, counted, closed at once.
//!
//! # Why this is not a way round "nothing runs without a click"
//!
//! [`crate::insert`] will not auto-start a program off a cartridge, because
//! nobody asked. `--play` is somebody asking: it is what a Play button in another
//! program runs. It is never what the watcher runs on insert.
