//! Windows settings that cost a cartridge real performance, and undoing them.
//!
//! Two of them matter enough to offer:
//!
//!   * **Defender scans the whole game folder** the first time anything reads
//!     it. On 60 GB of freshly copied files that is minutes of contention on a
//!     link that is already the slowest part of the machine.
//!   * **Search indexing** crawls the volume for the same reason, in the
//!     background, whenever it is plugged in.
//!
//! Both are opt-in, both are per-cartridge, and both can be put back — a tool
//! that quietly weakens someone's malware scanning and cannot undo it is not
//! a tool anyone should trust. Nothing here runs unless it is asked for.
//!
//! The Defender exclusion is the one with a memory. `Add-MpPreference` writes a
//! persistent record keyed on a path, and the only path a cartridge has is a
//! drive letter Windows hands out from whatever happens to be free — so the
//! cartridge that was `D:` last week is `H:` today, and `D:` is now something
//! else that nobody chose to stop scanning. Every apply reconciles that; see
//! `stale_drive_exclusions`.
//!
//! A third setting is worth changing and is deliberately *not* automated:
//! Windows sets removable drives to "Quick removal", which turns write caching
//! off. "Better performance" is the right choice for a cartridge that is always
//! ejected properly — which this project's launcher does — but the supported
//! way to set it is Device Manager, and the registry keys behind it are
//! per-device and undocumented. It is in the README as a manual step instead of
//! being guessed at here.
