//! Cartridge logic, free of any UI.
//!
//! Everything the launcher and the wizard actually *do* lives here: reading a
//! cartridge, finding games, deciding which drives may be written to,
//! formatting, copying, and writing the files that make a cartridge.
//!
//! It is a separate crate from the Tauri binary for one reason: the binary
//! cannot be compiled without webkit2gtk and a display, so tests living inside
//! it could not run in CI or on a contributor's machine. Here, `cargo test`
//! works anywhere.
