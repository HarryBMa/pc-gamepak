//! Formatting a drive to exFAT or btrfs.
//!
//! This is the only code in the project that destroys data, so it is built to
//! refuse rather than to succeed. Four things must all hold before a single
//! command runs:
//!
//!   1. the target is in `drives::list_drives()` — an allowlist of removable,
//!      automounted volumes, re-derived here rather than taken from the caller;
//!   2. it is not the system drive;
//!   3. the caller echoed the drive's current label back exactly;
//!   4. formatting was explicitly asked for, per cartridge. It is never implied.
//!
//! **NTFS is the default**, and it took hardware to work out why. exFAT was the
//! obvious answer — Windows, Linux and macOS all read it with nothing to install
//! — and it is the one filesystem here that cannot hold what a cartridge needs
//! to carry:
//!
//! * **No symlinks.** Steam installs a compatibility tool into the library the
//!   game lives in, so launching a Windows game from an exFAT cartridge makes
//!   Steam try to unpack Proton onto it. Proton contains 1,892 symlinks and the
//!   first one ends the install — `AppError_11`, "Disk write error", which says
//!   nothing about why.
//! * **No executable bit.** Nothing on an exFAT cartridge is executable, which
//!   is why a carried Linux game has to be a shell script and why the launcher
//!   runs one through `bash`.
//! * **No permissions that persist**, so `chmod` does not survive a replug.
//!
//! NTFS has all three, Windows reads it natively, and the Linux kernel's `ntfs3`
//! driver mounts it read-write through udisks like any other removable volume —
//! measured on this project's own hardware, at `/run/media/$USER/…` with
//! `uid=1000` and no root.
//!
//! The cost, stated plainly: **macOS reads NTFS but does not write it.** A
//! cartridge handed to a Mac can be played from and copied off, and cannot take
//! a save or a playtime count back. exFAT remains the choice for a cartridge
//! that has to be writable on all three.
//!
//! btrfs is the third option and is unchanged: TRIM (`discard=async`) and
//! transparent zstd compression, on Linux only, since Windows cannot read it
//! without [WinBtrfs]. Both benefits are thinner than they look here — a USB
//! bridge only passes TRIM through when it speaks UASP and honours UNMAP, and
//! game data is already compressed.
//!
