//! What a cartridge remembers about being played.
//!
//! `.gamepak/stats.json`, written on the drive rather than on the host. That
//! placement is the whole feature: a cartridge carried between a desktop, a
//! Steam Deck and somebody else's machine keeps one count of how often it has
//! been started and how long it has been played, the way a save file on a
//! memory card does. Per-host statistics already exist — Steam has them — and
//! they are exactly what a cartridge cannot use.
//!
//! Three rules, all of them consequences of living on removable media:
//!
//! 1. **Never fail a launch.** Every write here is best-effort. A cartridge
//!    mounted read-only, a full drive, a file some other tool has locked: the
//!    game still starts and the count is simply not kept. Callers log the
//!    error and carry on.
//! 2. **Write whole files.** A new file beside the old one, then a rename, so
//!    a drive pulled mid-write loses the update rather than the history.
//! 3. **Count the launch before the session.** A crash, a hard power-off, or a
//!    cartridge yanked out of the port takes the duration with it; the launch
//!    is already on the drive by then. Undercounting hours is honest.
//!    Inventing them is not.
