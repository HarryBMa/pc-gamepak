# Where the project is

A working inventory: what exists, what it does, and what is missing. Kept in the
repository rather than in a chat log so it stays honest.

## What is built

### `core/` — `gamepak-core`, 170 tests

No Tauri, no UI, no display. That is the point: every decision the launcher and
the wizard make is testable on any machine, in CI, without a webview.

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cartridge` | Reads a cartridge: `cartridge.conf` (single game, or `[collection]` + `[game]` sections) and legacy `autorun.inf` for label and icon only. Inline INI parser, path confinement, cover inlined as a `data:` URI under an 8 MB cap. |
| `create` | The build pipeline: close Steam and drop its stale entry → format → copy → check the launch target → cover art → `cartridge.conf` → `autorun.inf` → trim and report. Game lists from Playnite and Steam, collection naming, per-game covers. |
| `edit` | Rewrites a cartridge's metadata — name, artwork, which games are listed and in what order — without copying or deleting anything. |
| `drives` | Which volumes may be written to — an allowlist of automount locations, never a denylist. Parses `/proc/mounts`; Win32 volume APIs on Windows. |
| `format` | exFAT and btrfs, behind four gates: removable allowlist re-derived here, not the system drive, the current label typed back exactly, and explicitly asked for. |
| `health` | Negotiated link speed, UASP vs BOT, how full the drive is, and the volume's own name and filesystem. sysfs on Linux; the transport only, lazily, on Windows. |
| `playnite` | Reads a Playnite JSON library export: one list covering Steam, GOG, Epic, Xbox, itch, emulators. Finds Playnite on Windows and through Proton prefixes on Linux. |
| `portable` | Ranks the executables in a copied game folder so Play points at the game rather than its uninstaller. |
| `settings` | What the user has switched on, stored beside the artwork cache. Everything defaults to off. |
| `sgdb` | SteamGridDB artwork search, download and cache. Refuses every request until the user opts in and supplies a key. |
| `steam` | Steam's own manifests: `libraryfolders.vdf`, `appmanifest_*.acf`, the library cache for covers. Hand-written KeyValues parser. |
| `steamlib` | Copies a Steam game onto a cartridge and registers the drive as a Steam library, so Steam plays from the cartridge. Also unregisters one, and asks a running Steam to shut down so those edits survive its exit. |
| `trim` | Tells the drive which blocks it no longer has to keep. Treats "this enclosure will not" as a fact, not a failure. |
| `tuning` | The Windows settings worth changing per cartridge, the commands they run, and their exact opposites. |
| `verify` | CRC-32, taken as each file is copied and checked by reading the cartridge back. Leaves a manifest so the same check can be run later without the original. |
| `autorun` | Writes `autorun.inf` so Explorer shows the game's name and icon; builds a PNG-in-ICO when the cover allows it. |

### `tauri-ui/` — one binary, two windows

`pc-gamepak --drive <path>` is the popup; `pc-gamepak --create` is the wizard.
Exactly one window is ever built, so neither mode costs anything for the other.
24 commands, no command that takes a path to read.

**Launcher** — the artwork fills a 420 × 560 window, which is the slot the
cartridge is seated in: Eject rides the whole face out and leaves the slot
behind. Title, Play and an eject icon; everything else appears only under the
pointer. A collection grows a rail, and the one Play acts on whatever it has
selected, with `1`–`9` selecting and starting the *n*th. The accent colour is
sampled from the cover. A pad swaps the keycaps for face-button icons and gets a
focus ring that is always drawn. Details behind the ⓘ, leading with link and
free space and folding the paths away. Nothing on a cartridge runs without a
click.

**Wizard** — search your library, tick one game or several, pick the drive,
choose what goes on it, Write. Selection is always multiple: one ticked is a
cartridge, more is a multicartridge, and the second step for a name and a face
only exists for the latter. The third step groups the options by what they touch
and turns them into a numbered plan with a time estimate; the write itself
happens in the same window, as a log that ticks itself off. Formatting, copying,
artwork by file picker or SteamGridDB, per-cartridge Windows tuning.

### `watcher/` — both platforms, 28 tests

**Windows:** a hidden top-level window blocking on `WM_DEVICECHANGE`. No polling,
no timer, about 2 MB resident.

**Tags:** a second doorbell, on its own thread. PC/SC — `WinSCard` on Windows,
`libpcsclite` on Linux — loaded at runtime by name rather than linked, so a
machine without a reader has no tag support instead of a watcher that will not
start. The UID names a directory holding an ordinary `cartridge.conf`, which is
why the launcher needed no changes at all. Off unless the tags directory exists.
A line source (`UID <hex>` / `GONE` on a serial device or FIFO) covers readers
people build themselves, and is how the path is tested without hardware.

**Linux:** blocks in `poll()` on `/proc/self/mountinfo`, which the kernel wakes on
any mount activity. Used only by the rootless install — the system install has
udev do this and keeps nothing resident. Deliberately does not link
`gamepak-core`: core pulls serde and ureq, which is fine for a launcher that runs
for ten seconds and not for a process that is resident all session.

### `linux/`, `windows/` — installers

udev rule plus two systemd template units on Linux; two binaries and a logon task
on Windows. Both installers uninstall cleanly, including names from before the
project was called PC GamePak.

### Everything else

CI on every push (core, watcher, launcher, frontend, shell), a release workflow
that builds both platforms from a tag, AUR and Scoop packaging, and
`docs/PUBLISHING.md` for what each channel can and cannot install.

## What is missing

Ranked by how much it matters.

1. **A tagged release.** Everything downstream — AUR, WinGet, Scoop — points at
   artefacts that do not exist yet. Nothing else on this list unblocks as much.
2. **Nobody has run this on real hardware.** Every path is unit-tested and the
   frontend is screenshotted and driven in a headless browser against sample
   data, but no cartridge has been written by this code on a real drive. That is
   the next real milestone, not a feature. In particular the wizard's running
   panel — the throughput, the countdown and the log — is wired to the progress
   events but has never seen a real one arrive over time.

   Related, and now fixed: until PR #10 nothing on Windows compiled at all —
   `gamepak-core` had no `windows-sys` dependency despite calling the Win32
   volume API, and two more crates were missing feature flags. CI ran core on
   Linux only, so the failure surfaced in the launcher job and looked like a
   launcher problem. Core is checked on both operating systems now.
3. **Version numbers.** Three crates all saying `0.1.0`, moved by hand.
4. **Adding a game to an existing cartridge** still means writing it again.
   Editing covers everything that does not move files; adding one does.
5. **Programming a tag from the wizard.** A virtual cartridge is a directory
   made by hand; the wizard has no step for it, and nothing writes NDEF onto the
   tag so that it would work on another PC.
6. **Verifying a cartridge you already have.** The manifest is written and
   checked at copy time, but nothing yet re-checks a cartridge on demand — the
   pieces are all in `verify`, it needs a command and a button.
7. **Windows code signing.** Unsigned means SmartScreen on every download.
8. **macOS** is not supported at all — no watcher, no installer, no icons.
9. **The `gamepak-linux.sh` / `gamepak-windows.ps1` menu wrappers.** The README
   pointed at both as the way to install, and neither has ever been in the
   repository — `linux/install.sh`, `linux/install-user.sh` and
   `windows/install.ps1` are the real entry points and the docs now say so. CI's
   `shell scripts` job still globs `./*.sh` expecting them, which is why that
   job is red on `main`: either write the wrappers, or narrow the glob to
   `linux/*.sh`.
10. **The settings the design asks for that no command answers.** Per-source
   toggles with game counts, the artwork cache's size and an Empty button, a
   copy-speed default, and the launcher-on-the-cartridge options are all drawn
   in the design and absent here. The dialog is grouped the way the design asks
   and reports what was actually scanned instead of offering switches that would
   do nothing.

## The rootless Linux install

Built. `linux/install-user.sh` puts everything under `$HOME` and runs the watcher
as a systemd user service; `linux/uninstall-user.sh` takes it back out. You pick
between this and the system install by which script you run — the `gamepak-*`
menu wrappers the README used to point at were never written.

| Install | Trigger | Resident | Needs root |
|---|---|---|---|
| **System** (AUR, `.deb`, `install.sh`) | udev rule | nothing | yes, once |
| **Rootless** (`install-user.sh`, and what a Flatpak would use) | mount-table watcher, systemd user service | one process, ~2 MB | no |

Both run the same launcher and the same detection rules; only the trigger
differs. The rootless one is arguably more accurate: it wakes when the cartridge
is mounted and readable, where udev fires when the kernel first sees the
partition and its helper then polls `findmnt` for up to sixty seconds waiting for
the desktop to catch up.

Verified on Linux with a loop-mounted image: insert opens the launcher, eject
closes that launcher and leaves any other cartridge's window alone, and a
re-insert after a genuine eject opens a new one rather than being debounced away.
Not yet verified on real removable hardware, or inside a Flatpak sandbox.
