# the launcher on it. Nothing is executed from the cartridge here: the launcher
# shows the cover art and waits for the user to press Play.

# That is why there is no trust list any more. The old design auto-executed
# launch.sh on insert, so it needed a SHA-256 allowlist to be safe. Now a human
# clicks Play, which is a better gate than a hash of a file the same person
