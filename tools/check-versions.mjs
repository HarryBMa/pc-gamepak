/**
 * Verify every place the version is written says the same thing.
 *
 * The version lives in fourteen places across five formats, and every one of
 * them used to be edited by hand. Predictably, they drifted: at the time this
 * was written the crates said 1.0.1, `package-lock.json` said 0.1.0, and the AUR
 * and WinGet manifests said 1.0.0 — so two of the three channels people install
 * from were pointing at a release older than the code, and nothing anywhere
 * noticed.
 *
 * `core/Cargo.toml` is the source of truth, because it is the crate the other two
 * depend on and the one a human edits first.
 *
 *   node tools/check-versions.mjs            every site agrees, or exit 1
 *   node tools/check-versions.mjs --set 1.1.0  move them all at once
 *   node tools/check-versions.mjs --release   also: no checksum placeholders
 *
 * The `--release` mode exists because two sites carry a **checksum of a release
 * artefact**, which cannot be known until the release exists. Bumping the version
 * replaces those with a placeholder, which is the correct state between the bump
 * and the tag — and is not a state to publish an AUR or WinGet manifest in. CI
 * runs the default mode and tolerates them; `docs/PUBLISHING.md` says to run
 * `--release` before submitting a manifest anywhere.
