//! Cartridge watcher.
//!
//! Replaces the resident PowerShell monitor. PowerShell holds the whole .NET
//! runtime and a WMI subscription open for the entire login session, which costs
//! tens of megabytes to do nothing. This does the same job by blocking on the
//! Windows message queue: no polling, no timer, no CPU while idle.
//!
//! On Linux the system install does not need this at all — udev is already
//! running as part of the OS and starts the launcher through a systemd unit, so
//! nothing is resident. See `linux/99-pc-gamepak.rules`.
//!
//! The Linux arm here is for the other shape of install: no root, no udev rule,
//! a systemd *user* service. It blocks in poll() on the mount table instead,
//! which is what a sandboxed package can do — and, as it happens, fires when the
//! cartridge is actually readable rather than when the kernel first sees the
//! partition. See `linux.rs`.
//!
//! Flow: volume arrives -> is there a cartridge.conf on it? -> start the
//! launcher with `--drive X:\` and go back to sleep.
//!
//! A tag on an NFC reader is the same flow with a different doorbell: the UID
//! names a directory holding a `cartridge.conf`, and the launcher is opened on
//! that instead. Off unless a tags directory exists — see `nfc.rs`.
