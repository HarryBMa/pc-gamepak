//! The notification-area icon.
//!
//! The launcher is opened when a cartridge arrives and closes when it is
//! dismissed, which is right for a popup and wrong for the only way back to it:
//! close the window and the cartridge is still plugged in, still readable, and
//! completely unreachable short of unplugging it and plugging it in again.
//!
//! The icon lives here rather than in the launcher because the watcher is the
//! process that is already resident. Keeping the launcher alive to hold a tray
//! icon would keep a WebView2 host resident too — tens of megabytes for a 16
//! pixel picture, on a machine that is meant to be running a game. This process
//! is a hidden window and a message loop, and it already knows how to start a
//! launcher, so the icon costs a struct and a menu.
