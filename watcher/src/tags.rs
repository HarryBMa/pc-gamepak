//! Virtual cartridges: a tag stands in for a drive.
//!
//! A GamePak carries the game. A tag only points at one that is already
//! installed — so a tag is a directory holding the same `cartridge.conf` a real
//! cartridge would, and nothing else:
//!
//! ```text
//! ~/.local/state/pc-gamepak/tags/04A224B2C31D80/cartridge.conf
//!                                               /cover.jpg
//! ```
//!
//! That is deliberate rather than convenient. The launcher takes a path and
//! reads a manifest out of it; it has never cared whether the path was a mount
//! point, so a tag needs no launcher changes at all — only somewhere to point.
//!
//! The directory is named after the tag's UID. There is no wizard step for this
//! yet, so the way to learn a UID is to tap the tag: an unknown one is logged
//! with the exact directory name to create.
