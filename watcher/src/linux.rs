//! The Linux watcher: one process, no root, woken by the mount table.
//!
//! The system install does not need this at all — udev is already running and
//! starts the launcher through a systemd unit, so nothing is resident. This is
//! for the other shape of install: no root, no udev rule, a systemd *user*
//! service, and everything a sandboxed package like a Flatpak can actually do.
//!
//! It does not subscribe to udev. A sandbox has no `/run/udev`, and udev's
//! netlink group is not something a confined process should count on. Instead it
//! blocks in `poll()` on `/proc/self/mountinfo`, which the kernel wakes on any
//! mount activity — no timer, no polling loop, no CPU while it waits.
//!
//! That is also more accurate than the udev route. udev fires when the kernel
//! sees the partition, which is before the desktop has mounted it, so the helper
//! it starts spends up to sixty seconds waiting for a mount point to appear.
//! Waking on the mount table means the cartridge is readable the moment we hear
//! about it.
