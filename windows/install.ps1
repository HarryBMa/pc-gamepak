# PC GamePak installer (Windows)
#
# Installs two native binaries and a logon task:
#
#   pc-gamepak-watcher.exe   resident, waits for a volume to arrive
#   pc-gamepak.exe  the popup, started by the watcher on insert
#
# The watcher replaces the old resident PowerShell monitor. PowerShell kept the
# .NET runtime and a WMI subscription alive for the whole session to do this job;
# the watcher blocks on the Windows message queue instead, so it uses a couple of
# megabytes and no CPU while it waits.
#
# Experimental AutoPlay support is available as an opt-in registry hook that is
# best effort only: Windows can suppress or ignore it depending on policy,
# device type, and OEM shell behavior.
#
# Run it with no arguments for the menu, or pass -Mode to skip it:
#
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File windows\install.ps1 -Mode Watcher
#
# -Mode is what makes this usable from a package manager. Scoop and WinGet
# unpack the binaries but neither registers a logon task, so their notes send
# the user here - and `Read-Host` fails outright under -NonInteractive, which
# is how anything scripted runs it.
