# PC GamePak — Tauri UI

A compact popup that appears when a cartridge is inserted.
Built with **Tauri 2.0** (Rust backend) and plain HTML/CSS/JS — no framework, no
bundler, no network access at runtime.

![The launcher, showing cover art, the game title, and Play / Eject](../docs/launcher.png)

The window is 420 × 560 — the 3:4 of a cover — and the cover art fills it. Only
three things sit on top: what the cartridge is, **Play**, and **Eject**.
Everything the launcher knows beyond that lives behind the gear:

### Design notes

- **The accent colour is sampled from the cover art** at load, so the Play
  button belongs to whatever game is in the dock. Each pixel is weighted by its
  own saturation squared and biased toward the lit areas, because a flat average
  of any cover is mud. The ink on the button is then chosen for contrast against
  that colour, so the label stays readable whatever the artwork is.
- **The scrim behind the title is deliberately short.** It has to carry the
  title and the buttons and nothing else; a tall, soft gradient would dim the
  half of the artwork people actually look at.
- **Nothing is fetched.** Fonts are bundled as woff2 and the cover is passed in
  as a `data:` URI, so the CSP can stay at `default-src 'self'` and the Tauri
  asset protocol stays switched off.

### Keyboard

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Play |
| `E` | Eject |
| `I` | Toggle details |
| `Esc` | Close details, or dismiss the window |

## Previewing without a cartridge

The page serves a sample cartridge when it is opened outside Tauri, so the
window can be worked on without a physical drive:

```bash
npx http-server tauri-ui/app     # → http://localhost:8080/?drive=/demo
```

Append `&state=noexec` to see the case where `cartridge.conf` sets no
`executable`.

## Prerequisites

### Windows
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) (C++ workload)

### Linux
```bash
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libappindicator3-dev \
                 librsvg2-dev libssl-dev
```

## Build & run

```bash
cd tauri-ui
npm install
npm run build     # → src-tauri/target/release/pc-gamepak
npm run dev       # run it against a drive, for development
```

There is no bundler: the files in `app/` are shipped as-is, which is why
`frontendDist` points there. It is a directory of its own rather than the whole
of `tauri-ui/`, because Tauri embeds everything under `frontendDist` into the
binary — including, if it were allowed to, `src-tauri/target/`.

## The create-cartridge wizard

The same binary, started with `--create`, opens the wizard that writes
cartridges:

```bash
pc-gamepak --create
```

![The create-cartridge wizard](../docs/wizard.png)

Only one window is ever built — `main()` looks at the arguments and constructs
either the popup or the wizard, never both, so neither mode costs memory while
the other is in use.

The game list comes from **Playnite** where it is installed — one list covering
Steam, GOG, Epic, Xbox, Ubisoft, itch and emulators — read from a JSON export,
since Playnite's own library is a LiteDB file. Steam's `appmanifest_*.acf` files
are read too, across every folder in `libraryfolders.vdf`; that is the only
source on Linux. Art comes from whichever cache the game came from. Nothing is
fetched, and games mid-download are skipped, since a cartridge pointing at a
partial install cannot play.

Covers are loaded one at a time as you select a game: base64ing a whole library
into the webview at once would be tens of megabytes of IPC.

The wizard can also format the cartridge to **exFAT** or **btrfs**, copy a
Steam game onto it and register it in Steam's `libraryfolders.vdf`, and write an
`autorun.inf` so Explorer shows the game's name instead of "Removable Disk".
Formatting is opt-in and gated on typing the drive's current name back. exFAT is
the default, because it reads on any machine with no driver to install; btrfs is
there for enthusiasts who want TRIM and compression and can live with needing
WinBtrfs on Windows.

## Icon

`src-tauri/icons/` is generated, not hand-drawn, from the logo sheet
`docs/pc-gamepak-logo-hires.png`, the logo export upscaled 4x:

- the **striped badge** is the app (`--app badge`) — the launcher, its taskbar button, and the
  watcher's notification-area icon, which embeds the same `icon.ico`
- the **red cartridge** is the wizard's window (`wizard.ico`), so the two
  windows of one executable look different in the taskbar

The upscale's soft, white-tinted edges are cleaned first; then each picture
is cut out by its own transparency, centred on a square and shrunk in halving
steps to every size from 16 to 512. `logo-cartridge.png` and `logo-badge.png`
are the cleaned cut-outs. Each window is given its icons at its own DPI from
the `.ico` entry made for that size — Tauri on its own sets only the small
one, which left the taskbar stretching a 16px picture. Regenerate with:

```bash
node tools/make-icons.mjs --app badge
```

There is no `.icns`, so `bundle.targets` lists the Windows and Linux bundles
only.

## When nothing happens

The Windows watcher writes to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\PC-GamePak\watcher.log`, which is the first place to
look when a cartridge does not open the launcher — it records every volume
arrival and why each one was or was not acted on. The Linux helper logs to
`~/.local/state/pc-gamepak/helper.log`.

## How it gets started

The launcher takes the cartridge's mount point on the command line and shows one
cartridge per window:

```bash
pc-gamepak --drive /run/media/you/CARTRIDGE   # Linux
pc-gamepak.exe --drive "D:\"                  # Windows
```

Nothing on the cartridge invokes it. On Linux a udev rule starts
`linux/gamepak-launcher-helper.sh`, which waits for the automount and then runs
the launcher; on Windows `watcher/` sees the volume arrive and does the same. See
the [main README](../README.md) for the full path.

The window exits after Play, Eject or dismiss, so nothing stays resident.

## Cartridge format

Place a `cartridge.conf` at the root of the SSD:

```ini
executable=steam://rungameid/1091500
title=Cyberpunk 2077
cover=cover.png
```

Or use a classic `autorun.inf`:

```ini
[autorun]
label=Cyberpunk 2077
open=Game\bin\game.exe
icon=cover.png
```

Supported URI schemes: `steam://`, `heroic://`, `gog://`, `epic://`,
`playnite://`, `lutris://`, `http://`, `https://`.

```

The logic behind those commands lives in the `gamepak-core` crate at `core/`,
which has no UI dependency so its tests run without a webview:

```
core/src/
├── cartridge.rs   reading a cartridge: manifest, cover, holds_game
├── playnite.rs    Playnite library import
├── steam.rs       Steam manifests and library folders
├── steamlib.rs    copy a game, register/unregister with Steam
├── drives.rs      which drives may be written to
├── format.rs      exFAT / btrfs formatting, behind confirmation
├── autorun.rs     autorun.inf, drive name and icon
└── create.rs      the build pipeline
```

## Security note

The eject command uses `DeviceIoControl` (Windows) or `udisksctl` (Linux) to
safely flush write caches before the drive is powered off.  Always use the
**Eject** button rather than pulling the cartridge directly.
