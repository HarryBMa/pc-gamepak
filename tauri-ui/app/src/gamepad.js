/**
 * Gamepad navigation for the launcher.
 *
 * A cartridge on a shelf next to a TV wants a controller, not a mouse. The
 * webview already exposes the Gamepad API, so this needs nothing from the Rust
 * side and nothing resident: the polling loop only exists while a pad is
 * connected and the window is open, which is a few seconds per insert.
 *
 * Every action has its own button, and the stick only ever changes which game
 * is selected:
 *
 *   D-pad / left stick   move through the game list, on both axes
 *   A (south)            Play
 *   X (west)             Eject
 *   Y (north)            Details
 *   B (east)             back out of details, or dismiss the window
 *   Start                Play
 *
 * The window used to move focus between its controls instead, so reaching Eject
 * meant pressing down past Play and the rail. That is how a form works, not how
 * a thing plugged into a television works: on a console the buttons *are* the
 * actions, and up and down are for choosing. Four controls fit on four face
 * buttons exactly, so nothing has to be navigated to.
 *
 * Nothing here launches anything by itself — each button calls the same
 * function the mouse and the keyboard call, so a controller cannot do more than
 * a person at the keyboard could.
