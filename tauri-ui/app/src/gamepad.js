/**
 * Gamepad navigation for the launcher.
 *
 * A cartridge on a shelf next to a TV wants a controller, not a mouse. The
 * webview already exposes the Gamepad API, so this needs nothing from the Rust
 * side and nothing resident: the polling loop only exists while a pad is
 * connected and the window is open, which is a few seconds per insert.
 *
 * The mapping is the obvious one, using the standard layout every modern pad
 * reports:
 *
 *   D-pad / left stick   move between the buttons on screen
 *   A (south)            press the focused button
 *   B (east)             back out of details, or dismiss the window
 *   Y (north)            details
 *   Start                Play, or the first game of a collection
 *
 * Nothing here launches anything by itself — it moves focus and clicks, exactly
 * as the keyboard does, so a controller cannot do more than a person at the
 * keyboard could.
